# Camera RAW Previews
A Nextcloud app that provides previews for camera RAW images like .NEF, .CR2, etc.
This app also gives you preview of Adobe Indesign files.


## Requirements
* Probably **memory_limit** quite high.
* **imagick** or **gd** module. If imagick is available, it will use that for performance.

- Place this app in **nextcloud/apps/**

## Donation
